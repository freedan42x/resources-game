# resources-game

A text-based resource gathering&crafting-like game as a project for myself to (hopefully) understand the C language better. In its early stage -- undetermined when it will ever be playable. The code already was and is probably going to be rewritten cardinally a few more times because of different approaches to the problem, experience and ideas that I had.
